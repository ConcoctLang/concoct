Concoct ðŸ§ª
=======
Concoct is an imperative, dynamically-typed, interpreted, general-purpose programming language written in C.

:construction: **Note:** This project is very much a work in progress. The interpreter is not yet functional. Have a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/Concoctist/concoct/wiki/Roadmap).

For more information about Concoct, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/Concoctist/concoct/wiki).

### Building :hammer_and_wrench:
#### Requirements
* A C compiler that supports the [C99](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99) standard ([Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/), [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/), [MinGW](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw), [MSVC](http://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) >=2015)
* [CMake](http://cmake.org/) (>=3.1.0)
* make/[gmake](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (if using Linux/Unix, [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/), or [MinGW](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw))

#### Linux/Unix and Cygwin Steps
1. Install prerequisites:

   Debian/Ubuntu:
   ```sh
   # apt-get install cmake gcc git make
   ```
   CentOS/Fedora/RHEL:
   ```sh
   # yum install cmake gcc git make
   ```
   FreeBSD:
   ```sh
   # pkg install clang cmake git make
   ```
1. Obtain the source code via `git` or download a zip archive:
   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/Concoctist/concoct.git
   ```
   Or:
   ```sh
   $ wget https://github.com/Concoctist/concoct/archive/master.zip && unzip master.zip
   ```

2. In the top-level directory where `CMakeLists.txt` exists, create a build directory:
   ```sh
   $ mkdir bld && cd bld
   ```

3. Generate the `Makefile` (you can alternatively use `ccmake` here if you prefer):
   ```sh
   $ cmake ..
   ```

4. Build Concoct:
   ```sh
   $ make
   ```

5. There should now be a `concoct` executable under the `bin` directory if the build was successful:
   ```
   $ ./concoct -v
   Concoct v0.1.0 rev 148 (d976be2) (64-bit Linux) (Debug) built at 00:46 on 01-02-2022
   ```

#### Windows Steps
1. Install the prerequisite software. This includes [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) >=2015 with the "_Desktop development with C++_" workload as
   shown below. The aforementioned workload should include CMake. You can also optionally install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and add the executable to your path:

2. Clone the Concoct source code. This can be done via Visual Studio or by using a git client of your choice:

   Or:

3. Generate the CMake cache:

4. Build Concoct:

5. If the build was successful, `concoct.exe` should now exist in your output directory:
